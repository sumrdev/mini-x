## Risk Identification
### Assets in our system. 
In out system we six virtual machines hosted on digital ocean 5 of them are interesting to a malicious party. Our monitering is pratical for us but it does not hold much vallue.
### Assets and their value
- Application: The applicaiton is hosted on three seperate virtual machines each hosted. 
  - All information from can be found here
  - 3 nodes worth of Compute power
- Database: A single virtual machine running their 
    Identify assets (e.g. web application)
    Identify threat sources (e.g. SQL injection)
    Construct risk scenarios (e.g. Attacker performs SQL injection on web application to download sensitive user data)

## Risk Analysis
(https)
(man in the middle for db)
    Determine likelihood
    Determine impact
    Use a Risk Matrix to prioritize risk of scenarios
    Discuss what are you going to do about each of the scenarios
